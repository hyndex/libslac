# PlatformIO Complete Example

This directory contains a fully self-contained PlatformIO project
showing how to use **libslac** on an ESP32-S3 board.  The example
initialises a QCA7000 modem, polls it for incoming SLAC frames and can
be built directly with PlatformIO.

## Building

Install PlatformIO and compile the firmware with:

```bash
pio run -e esp32s3
```

The project pulls `libslac` automatically via `lib_deps`.
Custom chip select and reset pins for the modem can be configured by
editing `build_flags` in `platformio.ini`.

## Testing

This example only defines a single PlatformIO environment for the
ESP32-S3 board.  The unit test under `test/` can be compiled and run
on the host using a native environment if desired, but that
configuration is not included by default.
